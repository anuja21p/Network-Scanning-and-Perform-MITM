Overview:-<br>
This repository contains the work done during my internship, focusing on network scanning and executing Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks. These activities are essential in understanding network security, identifying vulnerabilities, and demonstrating the potential impact of network-based attacks.

Prerequisites:-
<br>
Operating System: Linux-based OS (preferably Kali Linux)
<br>Network Scanning Tools: Installation of tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, and bettercap.
<br>

Project Objectives:
1) Network Scanning: Learn and apply various network scanning techniques to discover hosts, services, and vulnerabilities within a network.
2) MITM Attack Execution: Perform Man-In-The-Middle attacks to intercept and manipulate communication between devices on a network.
3) Security Awareness: Highlight the importance of securing networks against unauthorized scanning and MITM attacks.
4) Ethical Hacking Practices: Ensure that all activities are conducted in a controlled environment, with proper authorization and adherence to ethical guidelines.

Ethical Considerations:<br>
This project is intended for educational and research purposes only. All activities should be conducted in a controlled environment, such as a lab, with explicit permission. Unauthorized network scanning and MITM attacks are illegal and unethical.
